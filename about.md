## Life


I was born in San Francisco, CA, but grew up in Pittsburgh, PA. Despite my mom working at Carnegie Mellon University and my aspirations to be an engineer, I decided I wanted a bit of a change, so I went to the University of Michigan, where I study Industrial and Operations Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I will be graduating in April 2018 and am excited to move to a new city that I can explore and grow with.
